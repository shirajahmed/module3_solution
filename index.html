                            The Chicken Farm Have you ever imagined what a chicken farm looked like? Have you seen the troubles a hen goes through before laying an egg? What about an egg about to hatch? Have you felt the excitement as you anticipate its coming out into this world?  What about the details in taking good care of a hen? Did you know that there are more chickens than humans on Earth? People would normally equate the word farm with boring, tedious, strenuous, and mundane. They would discourage whoever talks about going into farming. From sunrise to sundown, farmers would normally do the same thing. However, there is more to farming than the drudgeries of routine work. This is what the article is about. It will show you how people could learn something about a chicken farm in a fun way. You will get acquainted with the different stages in raising chickens. You don’t need a farm to know and experience all of this. You might want to try the various activities we have prepared for you on our farm. These activities were designed both for the old and the young; for those who’ve tried raising chickens and those who’ve don’t have the slightest idea. Whether you want to go for education or for fun, no worries, we have both.Earth? People would normally equate the word farm with boring, tedious, strenuous, and mundane.

                            Beef is raised and/or eaten in most countries of the world. It’s price and frequency of consumption varies depending on availability. In the US it is readily available and relatively cheap; this is why we eat quite a bit. In other parts of the world like Japan it is difficult to raise due to limited space so it eaten less often and is very expensive. During butchering each animal is divided into large “chunks” called primals. In butcher shops and some high-end restaurants you will find personnel who can butcher a whole side of beef. But in today’s supermarkets you will find people called meat cutters who do not cut beef from the side. They only break down beef from these large primal cuts into fabricated cuts that are sold at the retail level. Each primal yields specific market cuts. As animals move about in the field they exercise their muscles, on a beef the front shoulder area gets a lot of muscle activity. The rear of the animal also gets a lot of movement, but since they walk around forward the front gets more. The most muscle development and consequently the toughest meats, happens in the front legs of the beef. The amount of fat accumulation (which is certainly related to how much activity an animal has had and the type of feed they have been given) determines the grade the animal achieves. The grade determines the price per pound of the animal. The picture shows a piece of Kobe beef with tremendous marbling.ed diam voluptua. At vero

                            The Japanese live long, and this is already a well known fact. One of the proven secrets of longevity is that they eat fish, a lot of them. ‚·‚µ, the highlight of their fish cuisine, became very popular all over the world and had been representing Japanese food ever since. There is even a word in English: Sushi. There are numerous types of sushi such as nigiri-sushi, maki-sushi, and sashimi. In the 7th century, Southeast Asians introduced the technique of pickling. After 500 years, the Japanese acquired this same practice which consisted of packing fish with rice. As the fish fermented, the rice produced a lactic acid which in turn caused the pickling of the pressed fish. This was the very first form of sushi, and it was called Nare-Sushi. Then in 15th and 16th century, an altered form, Nama-Nare, appeared due to lengthy process. After a century, Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Edo introduced the use of rice vinegar into the sushi rice to add a flavor of tartness. One of the best known kinds of sushi, nigiri, wasnft introduced until 1820fs by Hanaya Yohei of Edo. His morsels, which included fresh sliced raw fish combined with the vinegared rice, were prepared and served for customers directly from his portable sushi stall. It eventually won immediate demands over the nation and descended the sushi bars of today. One of the typical nigiri sushi we eat is maguro, tuna sushi. In my experience, therefs not just one tuna sushi, but quite a few, such as an albacore tuna, a white tuna, a fatty tuna, and the regular tuna. Just like other sushi, vinegared rice and a piece of tuna are, at least, required to make a tuna sushi. Once they are ready, by taking a small portion of the rice to the middle of a hand, pressing it with fingers to make it form nicely round and fairly long, and placing a sliced tuna on top of it, maguro is made.
